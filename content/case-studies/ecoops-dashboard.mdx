## Problem

Operations managers lacked real-time visibility into facility performance. Reports were generated manually using Excel exports, delivered with significant delays that made proactive decision-making impossible.

Key pain points included:

- No real-time fleet tracking
- Manual inventory reconciliation
- Delayed KPI reporting
- No mobile access for field supervisors

## Scope

Build a real-time operational dashboard with four core modules:

1. **Fleet Management**: Vehicle tracking, route optimization, driver assignment
2. **Inventory Control**: Material stock levels, automated reorder points
3. **Operational Analytics**: KPI dashboards, throughput metrics
4. **Scheduling Engine**: Shift management, resource allocation

Requirements:

- Support multiple user roles (Admin, Manager, Operator, Viewer)
- Work offline for field use
- Export capabilities for stakeholder reporting
- Mobile-responsive design

## Architecture

### Frontend (Next.js App Router)

Server components for initial data load with client-side WebSocket connections for real-time updates. Role-based access control enforced at both route and component levels.

```

│   ├── fleet/
│   ├── inventory/
│   ├── analytics/
│   └── scheduling/
├── api/
│   └── [[...route]]/
└── layout.tsx
```

### Real-time Layer

WebSocket server (Hono) handling bi-directional communication. Updates pushed on:

- Vehicle location changes
- Inventory level updates
- Workflow state transitions
- Alert notifications

### PWA Support

Service worker for offline data caching. IndexedDB for storing pending mutations when offline.

## Results

- Real-time KPI visibility across all facility operations
- Reduced report generation time from hours to seconds
- Mobile-friendly interface for field operations
- Export capabilities for stakeholder reporting
- Offline support with automatic sync on reconnection
